# AWS Backup Elastio Integration to Help Protect Data from Ransomware, Malware, and Corruption.

Authored by: Adam Nelson, CTO of Elastio, Cris Daniluk, AWS Security Architect, RhythmicTech.

Typically, the first time backups are tested at the point of recovery. Those backups often contain latent corruption, malware, and files that cannot be restored due to ransomware. Elastio now integrates with AWS Backup to continuously scan backups for these threats, recovery testing them to ensure a successful restoration, and quickly identifying the last clean recovery point. 

Using Elastio, AWS Backup customers have confidence that their data is recoverable in case of ransomware, corruption, or any other threat. Due to its compression and deduplication capabilities, customers can increase their retention period while simultaneously reducing their storage costs. The entire process is run from within the customer’s AWS Organization. Elastio cannot view, access, or gain custody of customer data. By implementing Elastio, customers can better meet compliance requirements and decrease their overall risk and spend. 

Elastio ingests AWS Backup recovery points into its ScaleZTM storage engine, scanning backups in real-time for ransomware, malware, corruption, and other factors that affect restorability. Once configured, the integration is seamless, using Amazon EventBridge to receive notifications as new recovery points are created with the customer’s existing AWS Backup Vaults. Scan results can be consumed and alerted in real-time by security tools such as AWS Audit Manager, AWS Security Hub, Splunk, and Datadog.

If a cyber threat is detected and needs to be remediated, Elastio provides the ability to provide historical context and reconstitute material information for forensic interrogation from its cyber vault. 

In one click, customers can easily recover entire instances, selected volumes, or individual files to a secure and isolated environment. Elastio is also designed to integrate with existing incident response procedures. It supports sending logs, events, and alerts to leading SIEMs.

## AWS Backup and Elastio Architectures

### Single Account Configuration

1. AWS Backup creates a recovery point for an Amazon EC2 instance in the Workload Account.
2. An Amazon EventBridge event is triggered when the backup for the Amazon EC2 instance is completed.
3. The event triggers an AWS Lambda function that invokes an Elastio processing pipeline. The pipeline imports the recovery point and performs a cyber scan on all associated objects, including the Amazon EBS volumes and the Amazon Machine Image.
4. After the pipeline completes, detailed artifacts are generated and sent to Amazon EventBridge. 
5. A Job Status Lambda function is triggered to copy the artifacts to an Amazon S3 bucket. 
6. The artifacts are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Alternatively, the AWS Lambda can be modified to send artifacts to any system, including AWS Security Hub, Datadog, and Splunk.

### Cross Account Configuration

1. AWS Backup creates a recovery point for an Amazon EC2 instance.
2. The Default Event Bridge event is triggered when the backup for the Amazon EC2 instance is completed, and the copy is initiated.
3. When the copy is completed, the Job Status Event Bridge triggers an AWS Lambda function that invokes an Elastio processing pipeline. 
4. The pipeline imports the recovery point and performs a cyber scan on all associated objects, including the Amazon EBS volumes and the Amazon Machine Image.
5. After the pipeline completes, detailed artifacts are generated and sent to Amazon EventBridge. 
6. A Job Status Lambda function is triggered to copy the artifacts to an Amazon S3 bucket. The artifacts are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Alternatively, the AWS Lambda can be modified to send artifacts to any system, including AWS Security Hub, Datadog, and Splunk.


### Deploying AWS Backup CloudFormation

1. Log in to the AWS Account where the AWS Backup Vault exists.
2. From CloudFormation console, select Create Stack, Select "With New Resources".
3. Select "Upload Template File" and upload the YAML file.
4. Enter the stack name "aws-backup-elastio-integration"
5. Enter an S3 bucket name.  
6. Enter the ARN of Lamdba "elastio-bg-jobs-service-aws-backup-rp-import"
7. Optionally use all defaults and follow the wizard to create the stack.

NOTE: By using the Lambda provided in the AWS Backup Elastic integration, all backups will undergo scanning for all policies. In a future blog, instructions will be given on creating custom backup rules, which will involve modifying the Lambda that handles new AWS Backup events to exclude certain backups based on specific criteria.

### Conclusion
By using Elastio to enhance AWS Backup, organizations can secure their cloud data, reduce data loss and downtime, and improve Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) in case of an attack or application failure. Elastio imports AWS Backups as globally deduplicated and compressed, resulting in improved scan performance, shorter recovery times, and cost savings.
